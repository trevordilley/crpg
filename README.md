# CRPG Game
Mix Lords of Magic's site based dungeon overworld 
with Baldur's Gate style combat with a Dark Souls stamina 
management twist!

## Key Distinctions
* CRPG style combat, but less forgiving
    * Position and rotation are very important, getting shot in the back is real bad
    * Stamina dictates everything
    * Pause and plan style 

## TODO's by priority 

### Battle
* Attacks are determined by clicking on another entity
* Rotation mechanics
  BUG: Rotation sometimes doesn't know how to find shortest distance to
  rotate towards
  * When moving, different kinds of speeds affect how you rotate. If you command a PC to move to a point it may or may not
  need to rotate toward that point based on how fast it moves. 
    * Running: Can be rotated in any direction within a 180 degree arc centered on the direction of the run
    Default movement speed.
      * Examples: Running and gunning
    * Sprint/Charging: Can be rotated in any direction within a 30-45 degree arc center on the direction of the sprint. 
      * Example: Charging! Running like this burns stamina.
  * TODO: Different movement speeds
  * TODO: Rotate based on movement speed rules
* Health pips on character
* Make entities collide


### Overworld
* Map scene shows
* Place party
* Move party
    * LOW: Moving party drains stamina
    * LOW: Needs rest when stamina is drained
    * LOW: Stamina drains slower near familiar
    territory. 
* Populate with random sites
