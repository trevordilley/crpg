# CRPG Game
Mix Lords of Magic's site based dungeon overworld 
with Baldur's Gate style combat with a Dark Souls stamina 
management twist!

## Key Distinctions
* CRPG style combat, but less forgiving
    * Position and rotation are very important, getting shot in the back is real bad
    * Stamina dictates everything
    * Pause and plan style 
    * IDEA: Think about Nox gameplay, and 
    see if it can kinda scale out to RTS level scale. 
    Individually determine when units will attack, shoot, dodge roll, or be blocking.

## TODO's 

### Overworld
* Map scene shows
* Place party
* Move party
    * LOW: Moving party drains stamina
    * LOW: Needs rest when stamina is drained
    * LOW: Stamina drains slower near familiar
    territory. 
* Populate with random sites


### Battle
* Set origin of entity to center of sprite.
    * Currently it's in the bottom left corner.
* Select groups of characters
* LOW: Figure out Sprite rotation?
